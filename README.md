# Project Brief - 
The ultimate goal is to extract meaningful and actionable insights from patient-level data. By doing so, we can help Oakridge Hospital enhance efficiency, refine diagnostic and treatment processes, and track the spread of potential pandemics.

The company seeks to understand:
- Which variables are significant in predicting the reason for hospitalization for different regions;
- How well some variables like viral load, smoking, and severity level describe the hospitalization charges;

# Task - 
Analyzing the data provided and extract insightful findings, using statistical tests to substantiate our conclusions. Including relevant tables, graphs, and visualizations to illustrate key observations and insights. Ensuring that our solution captures our entire thought process, from data preparation through analysis, as the clarity and structure of our code are just as essential as the final results or visualizations produced.
